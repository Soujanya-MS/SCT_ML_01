House Price Prediction – Task 01

This project predicts house prices based on key house attributes using a machine learning model. It’s part of my SkillCraft ML Internship. The notebook explores the dataset, selects features and applies Linear Regression to estimate house prices.

Tools

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

What’s included

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Selecting important features
* Building a Linear Regression model
* Evaluating performance with MAE, RMSE and R² score
* Insights for improving accuracy

Next steps

* Add more predictive features like lot area and garage size
* Try advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost
* Apply feature scaling and regularization for performance boost
