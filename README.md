## 🏠 House Price Prediction | Task 01

This project focuses on predicting house prices using key property features and a machine learning approach. It was completed as part of my **SkillCraft ML Internship** and walks through the full workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation.

The notebook uses **Linear Regression** to understand how different features influence house prices and to build a baseline predictive model.
